# Minimisation of Average Job Scheduling Turnaround Time
## Jake May - 45436126

### Introduction
The aim of this project as a whole is to create a client that is based on a pre-existing simulator called 'ds-sim'. The goal is to implement a script that can schedule jobs to a server based on several different factors.

Stage 2 of the project revolves around the idea of improving upon an existing algorithm with the goal of achieving one of more of the following goals:
- Minimisation of average turnaround time
- Maximisation of average resource utilisation
- Minimisation of total server rental cost

I have chosen to improve upon the best-fit algorithm with the goal of minimising the average turnaround time for scheduling jobs.
